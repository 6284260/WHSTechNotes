I reformatted my journal and started to use unity for coding my game.
Response to prompt: Explanation of directions was good and easy to follow and the only challenges I experienced was from my own fault.

I struggled with Python only because it overcomplicates itself, and the main thing I do when it comes to a coding environment is overcomplication. I tend to overcomplicate things so when things are already overcomplicated it makes it so I can't track where I leave off. I also forget the commands in Python more often than not. In my experience of coding, i'm just not a fan of Python because of its complication, I prefer things like JavaScript and block code where I can build to that overcomplication level rather than just get to it.

This is a free week, I also laughed at unity over the past few days.

I laughed at Unity some more and tried to do something outside the lesson, it didn't work the way I thought it would. Its important to follow exact instructions to exactly replicate an end result. The thing about code is one small misunderstanding can shatter the entire program, precision is key to avoid this. Characters in coding can mean a lot, _ and - are not the same.

Computer science can take roles in making A.I that runs machinery in virtually anything. Computer science impacts everyone regardless if they don't know about it. A.I can run experimental data through filters and do calculations that people would take days for. A.I speeds up the overall ability to live through assisting those who require quick calculations in their work, through some way or another it ties back to you.

Game designers design the entertainment of the upcoming generation of gaming. Through rigorous work in code ranging from JavaScript to Unity, and others i'm too lazy to list. Game designers also come from a wide variety of backgrounds, some coming fresh out of high school and others graduating from specialized schools for coding and development. These people can grow in whatever direction they want to set their mind to and have no real designated path to go in their field. This is the kind of job allowing freedom and determination to flourish, I struggle to follow exacts, but find a way to make it work so this field really speaks to me, also I play video games so that might influence it a little.

Coding can improve problem solving skills very easily, as precision is crutial to coding functional programs. All fields of jobs are linked to these programs through a web or direct link, like how physicians use technology to improve their results. Coding enhances creativity through the limitless potential of coding application. Coding is able to improve upon existing systems and utilize aspects unseen by humans. Overall the ability for code to be as versatile and applicable to everything is dependent on the people who make the programs.

Coding is a double-edged sword as we all know. It can create programs to help people in the medical field to help save lives. It can make traffic light patterns to reduce accidents in cars. It can make computer software to educate students about computers. It can change the world for the better
Coding can also allow hacking into various interfaces. Coding can allow illegal aquisition of information and identity for others to use. It can facilitate robberies via deactivating camera/surveilence systems. It can allow people to remotely cause crimes so not much evidence is present. Virtual hacking is a major thing that coding can be used for. It can change the world for the worse.

Virtual voting is easier for the public to vote and also for the public to rig. The people behind the system can just adjust one number and help the party they think is good. If somebody was to adjust voting numbers by one in the other party's favor that party would be at an advantage over the other. It can change the world, just the minds of the people are how it changes.

Nowadays we share information over the internet more often than we don't, so how do we keep this information safe? You can save your data from sharing by making it only visible to you and a set of people you wish to share data with. If we don't use these basic precautions other people might take that information and use it wher you aren't. Like using your bank account to get money, but that person isn't you. I have shared phone numbers but never anything I thought was too personal. You can simply not share information you don't want to with the people you're working with, not all information is required. You don't have to share your bank account password with everyone.
