I reformatted my journal and started to use unity for coding my game.
Response to prompt: Explanation of directions was good and easy to follow and the only challenges I experienced was from my own fault.

I struggled with Python only because it overcomplicates itself, and the main thing I do when it comes to a coding environment is overcomplication. I tend to overcomplicate things so when things are already overcomplicated it makes it so I can't track where I leave off. I also forget the commands in Python more often than not. In my experience of coding, i'm just not a fan of Python because of its complication, I prefer things like JavaScript and block code where I can build to that overcomplication level rather than just get to it.

This is a free week, I also laughed at unity over the past few days.

I laughed at Unity some more and tried to do something outside the lesson, it didn't work the way I thought it would.
